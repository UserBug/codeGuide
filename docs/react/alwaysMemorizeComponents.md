## React - Always memorize components

To prevent unnecessary rerender of component and increases performance,  
each component should be memorized.  
Use recommended ways:

* shouldComponentUpdate
* extends React.PureComponent (Be careful, PureComponent correctly checks only immutable properties, objects are checked
  by reference.)
* React.memo
