## React - Basics of React Hooks

As a first step please read article from Facebook:  
[reactjs - Hooks rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)

* Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
* Only Call Hooks from React Functions
* A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.
