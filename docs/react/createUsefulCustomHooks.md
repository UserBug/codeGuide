## React - Create useful custom hooks

This list of hooks is recommended for creation and use,  
as it has proven to be convenient and effective:

```javascript
ReactMemo(Component, shouldComponentUpdate);
```  

Will memorize any Component by using function ```shouldComponentUpdate(prevProps, nextProps)```.  
shouldComponentUpdate must be stateless function.

```javascript
useComponentDidMount(fn);
```

Will execute argument function only once, when Component did mount.

```javascript
useComponentWillUnmount(fn);
```

Will execute argument function only once, when Component will unmount.

```javascript
useCallbackOnce(fn);
```

Similar to useCallback.  
Will return same function each time, no meter how often component renders.
