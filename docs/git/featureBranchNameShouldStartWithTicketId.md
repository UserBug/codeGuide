## Git - Feature branch name should start with ticket id

Availability of ticket id in name of the feature branch,  
allows people and issue tracking systems (JIRA) find and show valid links to the branch in Git repo.  
The best way to do this - is to create a branch for development directly from issue tracking systems.  
Examples of branch names: ```OOPP-76-some-feature```, ```EX-2391-some-feature```...
