## Styles - Stick to the same names in styles and code

It doesn't matter what tools you use to create your design  
(Figma; Zeplin; Sketch; Adobe XD; InVision...)  
use same variables names in the design instruments and in the code.  
Take time to agree on common rules with designers at the very beginning of the project.

* Speeds up design implementation
* Makes it easier to spot style issues
* Makes further changes easier
