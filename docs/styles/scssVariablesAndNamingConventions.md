## Styles - SCSS Variables and Naming conventions

Use variables for all numerical values, quantities, and sizes excluding atomic (0, 100%, etc.)  
All variables should be placed in the general theme files and distributed according to their purpose (sizes, indents,
colors, borders, shadows etc.).  
This will improve the visibility of the project and allow you to quickly change them.
