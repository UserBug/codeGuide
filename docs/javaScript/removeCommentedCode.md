## JavaScript - Remove commented code

All console logs should be deleted from files before the feature branch can be merged to the develop.  
These unnecessary logs make it difficult for other developers to debug the code and can show private data.

Delete commented out parts of the code.  
Blocks of code in the commentaries make it very difficult to read it and unnecessarily increase the size of the files.
