## JavaScript - Respect all eslint rules

Eslint is a very important tool in the development. It can be distracting in the beginning, but it allow:

* Check correct syntax.
* Perform static type checking.
* Unify the design of code throughout the project for easy understanding.
* Automatically fix minor problems, such as tabulation, spaces and quotation marks.
* Avoid many errors on writing code stage.

We are using list of Airbnb rules as common base,  
all clarifications and differences should be approved with lead developers and added to the document.
