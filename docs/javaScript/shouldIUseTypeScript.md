## JavaScript - Should I use TypeScript?

##### ✔ Objective advantages of TypeScript that are not part of the "HolyWar":

* Syntax similarity to other typed languages
* Small amount of additional syntax constructions which are not included in ECMAScript++

##### ❌ Frequent misconceptions about TypeScript:

* Provides only **Static Type-checking** at the time of writing code. There are no type checks in the compiled code.
  JavaScript can be typed with JSDoc.
* TypeScript it is not ECMAScript. There is absolutely no guarantee that the TypeScript features will be included in the
  next ECMAScript.
* At the moment (2020) there is no reliable and recommended way to run TypeScript for production either in the browser
  or on the server.

**Summary:** The choice between TypeScript and JavaScript most of all depends on your taste preferences.
