## JavaScript - Discuss and describe each new npm package

If your code required some new npm package, you should:

1. Discuss the reasons and need for the package with lead developers.
2. If the package is approved, add it to file "package.md": date, your name and purpose of this package.

This information allows us to understand all project dependencies.  
Next developers can understand tools which are already in the project, and not to add new one.  
If some package will require update or replacement, information will help to find a better solution.
