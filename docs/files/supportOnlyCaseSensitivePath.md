## Files - Support only case-sensitive path

According to the naming convention, register is an extremely important part of the name.  
For example, "User" is a class, and "user" is an instance of the class "User."

```javascript
// Two absolutely correct imports that can exist in one file.
import Documents from './components/Documents';
import documents from './components/documents';
```

The lack of sensitivity to the register leads to uncertainty of imports  
and the inability to correctly support the launch of projects on Unix.
