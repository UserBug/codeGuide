## Don't use JSX extension

For example, we have 2 files in the "lib" folder: "MyClass.jsx" and "MyClass.js".  
After compilation both of these files become "MyClass.js", which can lead to errors when using this file in the code.  
It is just one of many examples...  
**Summary**: JSX is not required anymore.
