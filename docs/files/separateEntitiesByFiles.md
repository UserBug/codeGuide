## Separate entities by files

If your logic requires more than 400 lines of code, it's time to think about splitting it into a couple of files.
For example: move all constants to file "constants.js", move large functions to separate files, move validations.

Benefits:

* The less code the easier it is to understand it.
* Files with clear names make it easy to navigate the project.
* Separation of code into small entities makes it easier to write unit tests.
* Conflicts in small files are easier to resolve when merging into a git.
* It's easier to split code into modules.
